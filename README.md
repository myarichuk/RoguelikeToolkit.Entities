# RoguelikeTools.Entities

This is a library to allow resolve entity templates for Entity Component System in a similar way [Ultimate Adom](https://www.ultimate-adom.com/index.php/2018/10/25/making-ultimate-adom-moddable-by-using-entity-component-systems/) is doing.
Supports entity template inheritance and creation of entity hierarchies.  
It is using the awesome [DefaultEcs](https://github.com/Doraku/DefaultEcs) library to construct the entities.
